## What is markdown for?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in a simple way. It is often used for creating README files, blog posts, and other types of documentation. It is versatile, easy to learn and it is very readable. You can use it to separate sections, add links, tables, lists, and more.
